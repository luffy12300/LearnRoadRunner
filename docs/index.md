# Migration
Road Runner has been updated to an entirely new api, with major changes in the tuning processes and the interface. While many teams choose to use Roadrunner 0.5.6, covered by this guide, the official Road Runner [1.0 docs are available for teams](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/installation/) and covers the tuning process well.
<br />
Learn Road Runner is still available for now, with everything that a team would need to set up Road Runner 0.5.6. If you wish to use the legacy version of Road Runner, continue on.
<br />
Learn Road Runner will not remain online forever, but it will always be available on [github](https://github.com/NoahBres/LearnRoadRunner). Instructions for running this site locally are in the readme.
